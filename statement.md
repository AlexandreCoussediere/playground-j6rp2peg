* **Interpreted:** Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging much faster.
* **Batteries Included:** It comes with a vast standard library that allows you to do everything from file manipulation to networking without installing extra tools.
* **Cross-Platform:** Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
