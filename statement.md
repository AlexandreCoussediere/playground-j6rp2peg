## 1. What is Python?

Created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in 1991, Python is an interpreted, high-level, and general-purpose language. It was designed with one core philosophy in mind: **code readability**.

### Key Advantages:
* **Simple Syntax:** Python’s syntax resembles the English language, making it easy to learn and write.
* **Interpreted:** Code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging much faster.
* **Batteries Included:** It comes with a vast standard library that allows you to do everything from file manipulation to networking without installing extra tools.
* **Cross-Platform:** Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 2. Setting the Scene: "Hello World"

In many languages, writing a simple message requires several lines of boilerplate code. In Python, it only takes one:

```python
# The classic first step
print("Hello, World!")
### 3. Core Concepts

#### A. Variables and Types
Python uses **dynamic typing**, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The interpreter automatically detects if it's text, a number, or a logic value.



```python
# Assignment: variable_name = value
name = "Alex"          # String (text)
age = 30               # Integer (whole number)
price = 19.99          # Float (decimal number)
is_learning = True     # Boolean (True/False)

# You can even change the type of a variable later
age = "Thirty"         # Now age is a String
